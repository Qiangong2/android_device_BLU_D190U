#Note

The actual site doesn't advertise the Spreadtrum version. The site advertises only the Mediatek version as you can see here: http://www.bluproducts.com/index.php/dash-jr-3g .
This is the D190U version. It has a Spreadtrum SC7715 (or SP7715, they seem to be interchangeable) processor instead of a Mediatek MT6572 processor.

List of known BLU Dash JR 3G variants (I should start collecting :D )

1. D190U

2. D190L

3. D191U

4. D192U

5. D192L

All of the D190x versions use the _SC7715_ processor... I WAS RIGHT!!!!!!! :D

Thanks BLU, really appreciate all the information you've given out.
